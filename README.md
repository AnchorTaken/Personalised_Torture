## Commands you need to know
npm i  
npm run dev

# Files
## Here is how the software is structured and what things I want you to remember

**/ or also known as root folder**
public - is for images and videos available to every used

**/src**
is your software files and is going to be mostly the only folder you need

there are a couple folders in this folder. you may ignore all of the besides components

**Now files**
App.vue is the main file you will be using as your point of reference. it will contain all the info you need to progress forward

main.js is your main system file. is the file that holds all of the code together and is the file that is called when the user visits the website.

Ignore this for now
