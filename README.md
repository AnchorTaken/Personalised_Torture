# Learn to code

## 🌱 Prerequisites

Before diving into the Vue code, make sure you've got a few tools installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

## 🌻 Terminal Commands

Open your terminal in Visual Studio Code and run the following commands to set up the environment:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## 🌼 File Structure and Key Points

Let's understand how your Vue software is structured! ✨

### `/` Root Folder

**public**  
This folder is for images and videos that are available to every user. Think of it as your resource bucket. 🌺

### `/src` Folder

**src**  
This is where the magic happens! Most of your development will take place here. 🌠

#### Subfolders to Ignore

Feel free to ignore other subfolders for now. The main focus should be on the `components` folder. 🌙

### 📁 Important Files

**App.vue**  
Consider this your main guidebook. 📖 It's your central hub that contains all the pointers you'll need to progress. Keep this file close! 🌹

**main.js**  
Think of this as the backbone of your application. 🌈 It holds everything together and is the first thing that gets executed when a user visits your website.
