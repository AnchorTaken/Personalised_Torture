  <!-- 02. This is a div. Think of it as a box that wraps whatever you need inside of it. That is all you need to learn for HTML-->
  <div></div>
  <!--  02.1 Optional -->

  <!--   Here are couple other tags that also will be used but are not needed for now -->
  <h1></h1> - <h5></h5>
  <!--  These are mainly used for headers. So any title you make ideally should be inside and H tag-->
  <p></p> <!--  This is used for paragraphs. So any text you want to write should be inside a P tag-->
  <a></a> <!--  This is used for links. So any link you want to make should be inside an A tag-->
  <img/> <!--  This is used for images. So any image you want to show should be inside an IMG tag-->
  <button></button> <!--  This is used for buttons. So any button you want to make should be inside a BUTTON tag-->

  <!--  02.2 Divs can be created either manually or making a "." and pressing tab straight after the period -->
  <!--  02.3 Divs and any other HTML components are called an element  -->
  <!--  02.4 Every element can have a class name or a "class" those clases dictate the styling on the elements -->
  <div class=""></div>
  <!--02.5 You will frequently see elements that look something like this -->
  <div class="relative m-auto text-xl text-zinc-500">This is a slice of text within the element</div>
  <!--  02.6 These classes dictate what styling is applied according to "tailwind" specifications.-->
  <!--  02.7 The explanation for the classes can be found here https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet. However you wont need those anytime soon-->
  <!--  02.8 That's HTML done. To wrap this up. If you are in need of creating an element just create a div and dont worry about it until you need to learn the other ones above. -->
